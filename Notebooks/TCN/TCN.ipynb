    "Our results indicate that a simple convolutional architecture outperforms canonical recurrent networks such as LSTMs across a diverse range of tasks and datasets, while demonstrating longer effective memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture is informed by recent research, but is deliberately kept simple, combining some of the best practices of modern convolutional architectures.\n",

    "The results suggest that TCNs convincingly outperform baseline recurrent architectures across a broad range of sequence modeling tasks.\n"
